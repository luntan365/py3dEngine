# py3dEngine
A simple 3d Engine Game written in Python 3 and Pyglet and demos using the three major python frameworks for OpenGL - Pyglet, Pygame, Pyglfw 

# Purpose
To create a 3D Engine Game written in Python 3 and above.

The examples are just to show how to use pyglet, pygame, and pyglfw with OpenGL.



# Features

1) The 3d Engine can load objects from Blender, wavefront files.

2) There is rotation and movement of each object loaded.

3) There is selection or picking of each triangle of a 3d object using

the method of Triangle id (select method) and there a implemented

ray intersect triangle method.

# The development version

4) The development version saves and loads the descriptions, locations, 

and rotations of each 3D object in a db.

5)  Further ideas to be added as they come about.
